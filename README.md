## Big Ideas in Computing: Week 6 Lab Exercises

## *I copied this template from a source online, we can edit and modify it however we see fit*
## Name
doSomething Project

### Description
This project is a project that can do something. What that something is exactly has changed, but currently involves returning numbers in response to a string input.
Also, there is a special case that can inputted to receive a surprise!

### Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

### Installation
If you want to install this program well . . . just copy paste! There isn't that much code so you should have no problem :) but if you want all this amazing detail contained within this repository, feel free to clone it and maybe you can suggest edits. 

This was all written in Python. 

### Usage
Example: 
```python
doSomething('hello')

output: 4273
```

### Support

### Roadmap
Plans to be implemented:
- Make it do something else
- Make it do something cool
- Make it do something smart

### Contributing
We are open to contributions. Note that we will take credit for all of your contributions if we accept them :).
